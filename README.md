## README
[This site](https://meizhu812.github.io) is based on a practice project of the ThoughtWorks Recruit Training Camp. Our Team (ACR) consists of 3 members:

* [kkkker](https://github.com/kkkker)
* [whisperrrr](https://github.com/whisperrrr)
* Me myself

After Nov 24th, 2019, the project came to an end. I forked the main site and will make changes by myself afterwards.

## UPDATE
*2019-12-11*
